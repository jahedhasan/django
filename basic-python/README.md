# Python Data Types

Python has several built-in data types, which are used to store values. Below are the common data types in Python:

## 1. Integers
Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, without a decimal point.

```python
x = 10
y = -5
```


## 2. Floats
Floats are numbers with a decimal point.

```python
pi = 3.14
temperature = -5.6
```

## 3. Strings
Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes (single or double).

```python
name = "Jahed"
greeting = 'Hello, world!'
```

4. Booleans
Booleans represent either True or False.

```python
is_active = True
is_finished = False
```

## 5. Lists
Lists are ordered collections of items, which can be of different types.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## 6. Dictionaries
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs.

```python
student = {"name": "Jahed", "age": 22}
person = {"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe"}
```
## 7. Tuples
Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable (cannot be modified after creation).

```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
dimensions = (5, 10, 15)
```
## 8. Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.

```python
colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

## 9. None
None is a special data type used to represent the absence of a value or a null value.

```python
value = None
```
