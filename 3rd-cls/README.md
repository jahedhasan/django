# Difference Between MVC and MVT

## 1. Introduction
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** and **MVT (Model-View-Template)** are architectural patterns used in web development.
- Django follows the **MVT** pattern, whereas frameworks like **Laravel, ASP.NET, and Spring** follow **MVC**.

## 2. Understanding MVC and MVT

### **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**
- **Model**: Manages the data and business logic.
- **View**: Handles user interface and presentation.
- **Controller**: Manages user input and updates the Model and View accordingly.

### **MVT (Model-View-Template)**
- **Model**: Manages the data (same as MVC).
- **View**: Handles the logic and processes data before sending it to the template.
- **Template**: Defines how the data is presented (HTML files with Django template tags).
